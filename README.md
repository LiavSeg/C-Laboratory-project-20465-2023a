# ****Systems Programming Laboratory project****

* This repository contains the source code and documentation for final C laboratory project  - 2023a at The Open University. 
* The project is based on a two-pass model and **includes a _preprocessor_ component** to handle macros.

* **_The preprocessor_** component handles macro expansion, allowing the use of macros for code reuse and abstraction. 

* It is designed to work on an **imaginary** computer with 8 general registers, each register having a size of 14 bits.

* #### Grade: 94
